How we met
Our paths first crossed in 2011 through the church ministry of The Salvation Army, where a quiet friendship began to bloom—rooted in shared faith and service. From simple conversations to moments of laughter, a gentle connection began to grow.
Fate, however, had its own small ways  keeping our story alive. We would often find ourselves meeting in Mathematics competitions, crossing paths in school corridors, and even catching glimpses of each other during church events—small, meaningful coincidences that felt like divine reminders of something beautiful that is meant to be.
When one of us found the courage to confess what the heart already knew, we both agreed to wait—to let our friendship mature and to give space for growth. We promised not to rush into a relationship until after college, believing that love founded on faith and patience would endure the test of time.
And true enough, in God’s perfect timing, seven years later, that quiet friendship blossomed into the love we now cherish—a love strengthened by faith, guided by fate, and joyfully celebrated as the beautiful story we continue to live today.

As the years went by, we built dreams together and planned the life we hoped to share. But life had another test waiting. One of us had to go abroad, and distance slowly became part of our story. There were nights filled with tears, moments of loneliness, and countless days of missing each other deeply
Yet, through every challenge, our hearts remained steadfast. Though miles stretched between us, our love never faltered. We kept dreaming together, waiting for the right time, and trusting that God would lead us back into each other’s arms. What began with faith has now endured with patience—and today, we stand side by side, ready to begin forever with the same love that never wavered, strengthened by every tear that taught us patience, and every prayer that brought us home to each other.

It took seven years before our journey together truly began. Then again, we found ourselves waiting—another seven years filled with perseverance, hope, and unwavering love that finally led us to our “I do.”
The waiting was never easy, but it shaped us—it taught us to love selflessly, to dream fearlessly, and to trust wholeheartedly.
From young churchmates to soon-to-be husband and wife, our story stands as a testament that true love, though tested by distance and time, always finds its way—and that what’s meant to be will always be worth the wait.
And now, as we begin this new chapter hand in hand, we remain hopeful and prayerful for the days ahead—trusting that the same God who wrote our story will continue to bless the pages yet to come.
